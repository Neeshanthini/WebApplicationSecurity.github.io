                       <div style="height: 160px;"><p>First step I try to understand good paraphrasing.Simply using synonyms, scrambling an author's words and phrases and then using these "rewrites" the information in my e-portfolio.Good paraphrasing requires that you genuinely understand the original source,I genuinely using my own words to summarize the points. I also using plagiarism tools in website so that I confirm points the paraphrasing with exact meaning.</p></div></article>
