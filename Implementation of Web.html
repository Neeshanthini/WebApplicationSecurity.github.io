                        <div style="height: 120px;"><p>Encryption is the basic process of encoding information to protect it from anyone who is not authorized to access it. Encryption itself does not prevent interference in transmit of the data but obfuscates the intelligible content to those who are not authorized to access it.</p></div></article>

                        <div style="height: 140px;"><p>Web application scanners test your sites for various vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). A more advanced tool used by web developers to check out is a Burp Suite, which offers a broader range of testing features and takes more time to master than more straightforward tools.</p></div></article>

                       <h2 style="font-size:40px;">3)Don’t Use Easy-to-guess Passwords</a></h2></br>

                       <div style="height: 160px;"><p>Most people are familiar with using some variation of their name, birthday, or favorite sports team to create a password they won’t forget — but those passwords are also likely to be stolen by hackers.Hackers’ most common trick is to access user databases full of clear-text passwords (in other words, not scrambled) that can then be used for malicious purposes like identity theft or distributed denial-of-service attacks.</p></div></article>

                       <h2 style="font-size:40px;">4)Use Subdomains Instead of Host Names</a></h2></br>

                       <div style="height: 100px;"><p>You can’t eliminate security risks, but you can make yourself a more challenging target to hit by using subdomains instead of hostnames to separate your work and personal life on a single device or server.</p></div></article>

                       <h2 style="font-size:40px;">5)Set up a CAPTCHA</a></h2></br>

                       <div style="height: 250px;"><p>CAPTCHA simply stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (sometimes called a human verification system). CAPTCHA is generally used on a website to verify that you are human. Still, it has many other uses in computing, such as password recovery, computer logins, user authentication, making forms accessible to adaptive technology software like screen readers (software that reads text on screen) or keyboard-only navigation interfaces, preventing automated spam submission on webmail services. The list goes on! It’s a handy tool when dealing with potentially problematic automatic input from users.</p></div></article>

                       <div style="height: 160px;"><p>Cookies are typically used to store session information or shopping cart data. But keeping sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers in cookies is very risky.It can be easily captured through various means (including browser malware) or even inadvertently disclosed in log files that are often stored on a server, along with cookies that are not automatically cleared between sessions.</p></div></article>

                       <div style="height: 160px;"><p> The Apache HTTP Server is responsible for hosting almost two-thirds of websites on the Internet today, making it one of the most famous pieces of software in history. Keeping Apache secure is a must if you plan to run a website with sensitive information on it. Here are some configuration changes you can make to increase security.</br>

                       <div style="height: 160px;"><p>Cookies are supposed to be tiny bits of information that websites use to keep track of information for things like logged-in users or a user’s shopping cart on an eCommerce site. However, if you’re working with sensitive data like usernames or passwords, storing it in a cookie is very risky.If looking for a quick way to make your cookies more secure, ensure don’t contain any sensitive data, like credit card numbers or passwords.</p></div></article>

                       <div style="height: 120px;"><p>Regularly creating and executing penetration tests will help you identify vulnerabilities in your code that hackers could exploit. Penetration testing simulates real-world attacks to see how far an intruder can get into a system.</p></div></article>

                       <h2 style="font-size:40px;">10)Use Rigorous Quality Assurance and Testing</a></h2></br>

                       <div style="height: 120px;"><p>If your situation at all allows you to, utilizing a third-party service that specializes in penetration testing or vulnerability scanning as an addition to your own testing efforts is a great idea. Many of these specialized services are very affordable.</p></div></article>
